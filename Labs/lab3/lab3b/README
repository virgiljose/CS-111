lab3b.py:
	lab3b.py is a Python program that analyzes a file system summary in the form a CSV file and reports on all inconsistencies. The
	inconsistencies are then reported to standard output. The program takes in a single command line argument in the specified form
	of the CSV file and is then analyzed to report block consistency audits, which includes reporting invalid blocks, reserved blocks,
	unreferenced blocks, allocated blocks that appear to be on the free list, and duplicate blocks. Additionally, the program reports
	on inode allocation audits, which tells if an inode is allocated or unallocated on the free list. Finally, it prints out a report
	on the directory consistency audits, which reports any allocated inodes whose reference count doesn't match the number of discovered
	links, unreferenced inodes, and directory entries that refer to invalid or unallocated inodes.

Makefile:
	Makefile is a file that builds and runs the deliverable program. It contains the following targets: default, dist, and clean. The
	default target copies the lab3b.py to a progam named lab3b and changes the permission settings so that anyone can execute the
	program. The dist target creates the deliverable tarball with all the necessary contents needed to submit the project such as the
	lab3b.py program, the Makefile, and the README document. The clean target removes all programs and ouput generated by the Makefile,
	including the tarball and the lab3b program.
