Included Files:
	lab4b.c		C source file. Checks and reports temperature with a specified sampling rate (default: 1/sec).
	Makefile	Compiles the program. Also includes the option to smoke-test the executable.
	README		This file. Describes included files and submission comments.

Submission Comments:
	1.	In my implementation:
			a) The button is connected to GPIO_51
			b) The temperature sensor is connected to AIN0

	2.	The recommended calibration constants for the sensor is off by around 10 degrees or more. Any incorrect readings is
		due to my decision to use such constants.

	3.	Regarding the button, I found that simply using mraa_gio_isr is more effective than sampling the state of the button
		every second. Using the latter method in my implementation is not always reliable; I found that I sometimes need to 
		hold the button down until the program would shut down. With the first method, a press of the button would immediately
		shut down the program as intended.
